# Fungal-Secondary-Actin-Pilot
This pilot investigates the distribution of conserved divergent fungal actins as well as their potential correlation with specific fungal traits

This pilot originates from an observation made by the Functional Annotation team. Using ProteinCartography on human actin, they identified a well defined cluster of divergent actins found mainly in fungal species. Primary actin functions have been the subject of many investigations and have been mostly characterized. In fungi for instance, primary actin are known to be involved in growth, cytoskletton traffick and cell division. Yet divergent actins with modfied strucure are expected to underly potentially unknown/different functions than primary actins (in fungi or any other species). In this pilot, we want to understand if these specific divergent actins, further refered to as fungal secondary actin (FSA) are restricted to Fungi and if they evolutonary correlate with particular fungal traits. 
In this pilot we: (i) use sequence-based and structure-based search to characterize the distribution of these FSA in different kingdoms and within the Fungi kingdom, (ii) conduct trait mapping between these FSA and a variety of fungal traits, and (iii) use statistical model (phylogeny-based statistical modeling) to test whether there is any evolutionary correlation between these FSA and fungal traits
